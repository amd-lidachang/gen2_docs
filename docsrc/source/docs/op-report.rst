Operator Assignment Report
==========================

Once the compilation is complete, the number of operators accelerated on the NPU is displayed. For example:

.. code-block:: text

   [Vitis AI EP] No. of Operators : VAIML   124
   [Vitis AI EP] No. of Subgraphs : VAIML     1

If some operators cannot be mapped to the NPU, they are offloaded to the CPU. For example:

.. code-block:: text

   [Vitis AI EP] No. of Operators : CPU 10 VAIML 357

The compiler also generates a file named `vitisai_ep_report.json` that provides a report on model operator assignments across CPU and NPU. This file is automatically generated in the directory containing the compiled model (`cache_dir/cache_key`).

.. note::

   To generate the `vitisai_ep_report.json` file in this release, set the environment variable `XLNX_ONNX_EP_REPORT_FILE` before compilation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export XLNX_ONNX_EP_REPORT_FILE=vitisai_ep_report.json

This report includes information such as the total number of nodes, the list of operator types in the model, and which nodes and operators run on the NPU or on the CPU. Additionally, the report includes node statistics, such as input to a node, the applied operation, and output from the node.
